# bayes_opt

TO-DO:

-allow different initial space-filling method for initial observations (besides totally random) (e.g. uniform)
-allow initial observations to be provided as a list
-acquistion functions e.g. EI
-get 1D and 2D examples working

BUGS:



OTHER NOTES:

-Sampling from the posterior GP via the Cholesky decomposition gives very "kinked" curves compared to the other method - 
is there a reason for this?
